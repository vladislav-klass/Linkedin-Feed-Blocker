# Linkedin-Feedblocker
Linkedin Feed blocker 2023

ðŸš« Tired of your LinkedIn feed constantly demanding your attention? So was I! As a solution, I created a script to hide the LinkedIn feed. Why? Because available Chrome plugins just weren't up to the task anymore. Want to reclaim your focus and headspace? Here's how:

Install the Tampermonkey Chrome Extension - it's a user-friendly interface to manage user scripts.

Click on the Tampermonkey extension icon and select "Create a new script" - this will open up a platform for you to customize your browsing experience.

In the editor, replace the existing content with my user script below. Easy, right?


I built this script because the mental clutter that comes with an overactive feed can be quite distracting. I hope it helps you as much as it's helped me.

Give it a try and let me know your thoughts. Does it make your LinkedIn experience smoother?
